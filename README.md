## Things I've Learned
* Definition root class, stored property, and behavior.
  * Root class are the main class with a capital letter in the first word.
  * Stored property are the variables inside root class.
  * Behavior are list of functions inside root class.
* Inheritance of root class.
  * `super.init()` to initialize inherited root class.
  * `override func` to implement a custom behavior from inherited root class.
* `static let/var` to create a non-dynamic or rarely changed value of a stored property.
